# Session State Failure in ASP.NET Core Application

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** August 18, 2024, 09:00 - 12:00 UTC  
**Impact:** On August 18, our session state decided to play a prank, randomly logging out about 50% of our active users. This unexpected “break” from sessions led to significant user frustration and disrupted service.

## Timeline

- **09:00 UTC** - **Issue Detected:** Users began experiencing unexpected logouts and session losses.
- **09:15 UTC** - **Monitoring Alert:** Increased support tickets and complaints triggered alerts from our monitoring system.
- **09:30 UTC** - **Initial Investigation:** Engineers dove into logs, discovering session-related errors.
- **10:00 UTC** - **Misleading Paths:** Initial assumptions pointed to a recent code deployment, leading to an unnecessary rollback.
- **10:30 UTC** - **Escalation:** The incident was escalated to the senior development team and system administrator for a deeper dive.
- **11:00 UTC** - **Root Cause Identified:** Found that a misconfiguration in the session state settings of the ASP.NET Core application was the culprit.
- **11:30 UTC** - **Resolution:** Corrected the session state configuration, resolving the issue. Users were able to resume their sessions without further problems.

## Root Cause and Resolution

### Root Cause

The issue stemmed from an incorrect configuration in our session state settings. Specifically, the session state was configured to use a distributed cache, but the cache settings were misconfigured. This misconfiguration caused session data to be lost between requests, akin to a sieve that couldn’t hold water.

### Resolution

The distributed cache configuration was corrected to ensure proper session state management. We aligned the settings with best practices for session state storage. A thorough review was performed to ensure the issue wouldn’t recur.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements

- **Deployment Checks:** Implement more stringent configuration checks during deployments to catch issues early.
- **Automated Tests:** Develop automated tests to validate session state management before deployment.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Improve monitoring and alerting for session-related issues to detect problems faster.

### Tasks

1. **Review and Update Documentation:** Ensure session state configuration documentation is accurate and up-to-date.
2. **Implement Validation Scripts:** Develop and integrate scripts to validate session state configuration as part of the deployment process.
3. **Automated Testing:** Create and integrate automated tests specifically for session state persistence.
4. **Update Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring to include specific alerts for session state failures.
5. **Post-Implementation Review:** Conduct a review to verify that no further issues exist and to refine the process.
