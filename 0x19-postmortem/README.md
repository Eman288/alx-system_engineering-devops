# Session State Failure in ASP.NET Core Application

## Issue Summary
**Duration:** August 18, 2024, 09:00 - 12:00 UTC  
**Impact:** Session state failures resulted in users being logged out randomly. Approximately 50% of active users experienced unexpected logouts, leading to disrupted service and user frustration.

## Timeline
- **09:00 UTC** - Issue detected: Users began reporting random logouts and session loss.
- **09:15 UTC** - Issue detected by monitoring: Increased support tickets and user complaints triggered alerts in the monitoring system.
- **09:30 UTC** - Initial investigation: The engineering team investigated the application logs and noted session-related errors.
- **10:00 UTC** - Misleading paths: Assumed the issue was related to a recent code deployment, leading to a rollback.
- **10:30 UTC** - Escalation: Incident escalated to the senior development team and system administrator for deeper analysis.
- **11:00 UTC** - Root cause identified: Discovered that the issue was due to incorrect configuration of session state in the ASP.NET Core application.
- **11:30 UTC** - Resolution: Correct configuration was applied, and the issue was resolved. Users were able to re-establish their sessions without further problems.

## Root Cause and Resolution
### Root Cause
The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in the session state settings of the ASP.NET Core application. Specifically, the session state was set to be stored in a distributed cache, but the cache configuration was incorrect, leading to session data not being properly retained between requests.

### Resolution
The configuration of the distributed cache was corrected to ensure proper session state management. The application settings were updated to align with best practices for session state storage, and a thorough review of the configuration was conducted to prevent similar issues.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements
- Enhance session state configuration checks during deployments.
- Implement automated tests to validate session state management.
- Improve monitoring and alerting for session-related issues.

### Tasks
- Review and update session state configuration documentation.
- Implement configuration validation scripts as part of the deployment process.
- Develop and integrate automated tests for session state persistence.
- Update monitoring to include specific alerts for session state issues.
- Conduct a post-implementation review to ensure no further issues are present.
